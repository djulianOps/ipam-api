# üì° IPAM API

An **IP Address Management (IPAM) API** built with **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL**.  
It allows you to manage Virtual Networks (**VNets**) and **Subnets** with full CRUD support, CIDR validation, overlap checks, and detailed network information (address, netmask, broadcast, etc.).

---

## üöÄ Technologies
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)  
- [SQLAlchemy 2.0](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/)  
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)  
- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/)  
- [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/) (migrations support)

## üì¶ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/djulianOps/ipam-api.git
cd ipam-api
```

### 2. Start services with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

Start PostgreSQL on port 5432

Start the API on port 8000

### 3. Check API health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/ping
```
Expected response:
```json
{"ping": "pong"}
```

### üìù Logs

Logs are configured in **logging.conf** and output to stdout.
They can be easily integrated into observability tools such as Datadog, Grafana Loki, or ELK Stack.
